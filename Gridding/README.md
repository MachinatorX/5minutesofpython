# Gridding Gravity Data in Southwest Wyoming

This folder contains a jupyter notebook that has all the data you need to create a gravity anomaly map
for southwest Wyoming. The data was collected by Bankey and Kulik (1985) and digitized in 2018.

To run this notebook, download the folder, open the notebook and run through the cells in order.
It will install verde, which is used for gridding, and walk you through what each cell does to
grid the gravity data.
