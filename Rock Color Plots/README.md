# Coloring Geochemistry Data
This folder contains a jupyter notebook and one `.csv` file used to color geochemistry plots
according to rock sample colors. This notebook opens the `.csv` file that includes
eight elements (E1-E8) and RGB values for 138 rock samples. It then converts the RGB values
to hex values and uses them to `scatterplot` elemental concentration for each sample accoring
to the rock samples color.

To run this notebook, download/clone the folder, open the notebook and run through all the cells in order.
