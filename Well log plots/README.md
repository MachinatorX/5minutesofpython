# Coloring Well Log LAS Files
This folder contains a jupyter notebook that has all the data you need to create a colored gamma-ray log for a well in Campbell County, Wyoming. The data is from the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission for a well drilled in 2011. 

To run this notebook, download the folder, open the notebook and run through all the cells in order. It will install `lasio`, which is used for reading well log LAS files, and it will walk you through a quick data QC and how to read the files before plotting it up.
