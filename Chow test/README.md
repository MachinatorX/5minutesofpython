# Chow Test in Python for Linear Data
This folder contains a jupyter notebook that has everything you need to 
run a Chow test on a linear dataset.

Download the folder, open the notebook and run through the cells in order.
It will install the chow_test package from github and walk you through 
what each cell does to find the breakpoint in the data.
More information on the Chow test can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_test
