# Resampling WTI Oil Prices
This folder contains a jupyter notebook and associated data to resample WTI oil price data.

Just download the folder, open the notebook and work through what each cell is doing. This notebook reads in the historical WTI and Brent oil prices, builds a `DataFrame` with the WTI price and resamples it to bi-weekly and half-yearly intervals.
