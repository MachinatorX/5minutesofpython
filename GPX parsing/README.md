# Parsing GPX files
This folder contains a jupyter notebook and a `.gpx` file for an introduction to parsing
and organizing data from `.gpx` files. This notebook parses through the file and pulls
location and elevation data before it pulls out heart rate data. Then the data is organized
and visualized. 

To run this notebook, download/clone the folder, open the notebook and run through all the cells in order.
