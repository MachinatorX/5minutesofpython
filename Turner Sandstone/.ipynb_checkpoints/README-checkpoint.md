# Plotting Oil and Gas Wells in the Powder River Basin
This folder contains a jupyter notebook and assoicated excel workbook for
plotting up horizontal oil and gas well locations. The data is from the
Wyoming State Geological Survey Report of Investigations 77.

To run this notebook, download/clone the folder, open the notebook and
run through all the cells in order. It will install `xclr` and `cartopy`
which are used to read in the data and plot it on a basemap.
