# Creating a GeoDataFrame
This folder contains a jupyter notebook and a `.csv` file for an introduction to creating
a GeoDataFrame from raw tabular data. This notebook opens the `.csv` file and extracts
the latitude and longitude of each point. It then takes the points and creates a 
`GeoDataFrame` using `geopandas`. From the `GeoDataFrame` it then calculates distance
between points, time between points, and speed at each point.

To run this notebook, download/clone the folder, open the notebook and run through all the cells in order.
